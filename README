This repository is just some random code I've written up. I'll describe what the individual files do below.

uncertainty.py:
I wrote this because I was too lazy to calculate the uncertainties for my physics lab.
Uses the computational method to calculate the uncertainty of a formula, given the formula, the variable values, and the uncertaintys.
Use:
python uncertainty.py variables uncertainties formula
Separate the indiviudal values in variables and uncertainties with commas, and ensure there is a space between variables, uncertainties, and formula.
Formula variables must be entered as n[x]
Ex: python uncertainty.py 1,2,3,4 0.1,0.15,0.05,0.1 n[0]*n[1]+n[2]*n[3]
