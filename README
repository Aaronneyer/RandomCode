This repository is just some random code I've written up. I'll describe what the individual files do below.

uncertainty.py:
I wrote this because I was too lazy to calculate the uncertainties for my physics lab.
Uses the computational method to calculate the uncertainty of a formula, given the formula, the variable values, and the uncertaintys.
Use:
import uncertainty
uncertainty.calculateUncertainty(variables, uncertainties, formula)
Ex: uncertainty.calculateUncertainty([1,2,3,4],[0.123, 0.541, 0.1, 0.3], "n[0]+n[1]*(n[2]/n[3])")
Variables in the formula must be entered as n[x].
